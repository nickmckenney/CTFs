vmmap
	look at memory mappings
	goal: leak an address from a mem region to find its address space
	why: offsets between 2 mem addresses are the same
	more: offsets between 2 addresses from 2 differents regions will change
	
	In pwndbg I can see if a stack has NX perms
pie
	Like ASLR
	used in binary code or mem region

DEFEAT ASLR/PIE
	 leak a single address from the memory region. Then since the offsets stay the same every time, you can figure out the address of anything in that memory region.
