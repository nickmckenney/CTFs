overflow the first input and change the value of fmt.
	Since name is close to fmt, I can change the value


change the format specifier stored on the stack.
	This allows me to change the size of the buffer from 30 to 99 so I can overflow to the ret
		
	to overflow i use cyclic and investigate the saved EIP. this will be returned when i ret from my current function
		this will be the saved EIP
